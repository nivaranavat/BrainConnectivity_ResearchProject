notes from presentation 12/9
-flexibility to adapt to existing brain function and precision in selecting new activities
-being able to adapt in that modular structure might be better or not
-modular or nearly decomposable structures are aggregate of small subsystems that can perform certain specific functions without perturbing the remainder of the system
	-seems like a system that can work independently
	-reduces codependency
	-enhances robustness
	-reduces constraints on change
-hypothesize that the principle of modularity would characterize the fundamental organization of human brain functional connectivity during learning
-At each scale, we found Q(modularity index) to be larger than expected in a random network, indicating a significant segregation of the brain into distinct modules or communities
